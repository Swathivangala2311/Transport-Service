# Transport-Service
Build a travel booking system where different transport modes (Bus, Train, Flight) can be injected dynamically. Define an interface TransportService with a method bookTicket(String source, String destination). Implement BusService, TrainService, and FlightService. Use @qualifier to dynamically inject the transport mode.
